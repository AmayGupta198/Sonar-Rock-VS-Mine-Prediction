# Sonar-Rock-VS-Mine-Prediction

I developed a machine learning project for sonar rock versus mine prediction. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project can accurately classify sonar signals into either rocks or mines. This tool holds practical significance for identifying underwater objects using sonar data, potentially contributing to various applications in ocean exploration and security.

# Objective
1. Develop a machine learning model for sonar signal classification.
2. Train the model to accurately differentiate between rocks and mines.
3. Create a predictive system to classify sonar signals in real-time.
4. Provide a tool for underwater object identification using sonar data.
5. Contribute to applications in ocean exploration and security with accurate classification capabilities.

# Methodology 
1. Data Collection: Gather sonar signal data representing rocks and mines.
2. Model Selection: Choose suitable machine learning algorithms.
3. Model Training: Train the selected model(s) with the collected data.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Prediction System: Develop a system to classify sonar signals in real-time.
6. Deployment: Deploy the trained model(s) for practical use.
